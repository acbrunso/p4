## Description
This is project  which is used to allow users to generate either lorem
ipsum paragraphs, fake profiles, and select an xkdc style random password.  

## Details for teaching team
No login required
I added the xkdc password generator as an extra challenge for the extra
points.

## Outside code
I used the badcow/lorem-ipsum package for the lorem-ipsum page.
I used the fzaninotto/faker package for the profiles, and the
password is generated from the wisdom of xkcd.

##Other details worth noting
I generated a template style
navigation system so that files can be reused if necessary.
